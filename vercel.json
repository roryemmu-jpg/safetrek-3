```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ],
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "index.html",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build"
    }
  ]
}
```

- The `"rewrites"` section ensures that all requests to your website's URL (e.g., `your-site.vercel.app/` or `your-site.vercel.app/any-path`) are directed to your `index.html` file.
- The `"builds"` section is the most important part here. It explicitly tells Vercel to use the `@vercel/static-build` builder for your `index.html` file. This prevents Vercel from trying to run any Python or other build processes.
